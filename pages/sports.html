        suggests the academy is owned by Dronacharya Awardee Rambir Singh Khokhar. We have seen him training the likes
        of Ajay Thakur, Pardeep Narwal, and Surender Nada. After retirement from SAI where he produced one great player
        after another, he is back to what he does best, coaching. There is not a single day when he doesn't visit the
        academy, giving his valuable skill tips to the young players. In one of the many conversations we have had, he
        shared about his confidence in churning out skilled and fit players who will play for India one day. He is
        assisted by 2 full-time coaches in the academy.

        <h2>Welcome to My G5 Academy</h2>
        More than three decades back, as a young 13 year old boy , Sylvester, founder of MY Angels Academy (MAA)
        comprehended the true meaning of success and happiness which lies not with one but with all. He embarked on a
        transformational journey through love and football giving “ANGELS” to us.

        As Sylvester affectionately calls his students at my angels academy, “Angels “are the underprivileged children.
        MAA is a phenomenal story of transforming these children who were rag-pickers, petty thieves, drug addicts and
        even religious fundamentalists to “angels “of dignity, honesty and respect.

        We aspire to have a positive impact on society and to return the underprivileged children their childhood. We
        also ensure that these two core values/aims are imbibed by each one of our angels(“children under our wings”)
        i.e. to become “self reliant “ and to become “good and caring human beings”.
